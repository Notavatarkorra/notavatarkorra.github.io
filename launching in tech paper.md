built a team based on values not friendships
couldn't take off the friend hat and see them as ceo\

they had a team in the ukraine and they had to separate
everything is personal as a founder its hard to make decisions and they can be painful but everything is personal

russia controlled the ukraine media russia had assured ukraine 

going beyond your skillset
strengths and value got them to the right team
networking and partners

taking of the founder hat to be ceo
hyper deliberte and hyper prescriptive 
how we progress toward that 100 day vision this is the type of person i need to become to deliver on this vision

at the earlier stages you are both founder and ceo
theres a point where you transition to fully ceo and it can be hard to make that transition

thinking several steps ahead
identifying where the gaps are and digging in and being willing to fill it

dev shop is a development shop its way alot of people get tech support 
it is outsourcing for technical talent and you can outsource any part of it but esp early on they may have something in house but the bulk 

outsourcing in the beginning and then you have the resources to bring everything in house local talent

what is there business
displacing amazon, don't want to replace them
amazon is deliberately designed to canabalize small business
amazon basics 
they talked to people in amazon and that gave them a lot of critical information for the direction they need to move in

for every dollar they make they owe amazon anywhere from 80 cents to a dollar and 40 cents but its great pr, leverage amazon for visibility and then steal that clientel back

amazon starts this campaign where they throw alot of free things to you and getting services for free but they are learning your secret sauce so they can replicate you and then replicate it on amazon basics and charge them 80 percent less wowwww

because amazon can compete on price indefinitely that merchant is going to go out of business because they can't mass produce to compete

provide merchants a better solution to reaching their customers and offering a credit solution for short term loans to help them scale and grow to the next level

marvine francis onkin

has the business model changed

proximity to the person you are serving is important
you understand their pain points acutely and intimately you can ideate around solutions before they communicate those needs to you

big advantage to beind the little david, while competitors golioths have the oppertiunity tog et it right small businesses is geting real up close and personal to the small business to see how they are affected and let that inform their messaging and prodcuts so its an advantage 

marketing is not you get it right forever its constant expiramentation and constnat listening and constant pivoting and close proximity will help you excel

if i asked my customers what they wanted they would ask for a faster horse, it is your job to read between the lines and use intitution that you are not saying this but what you need is a car 

chat gpt does a good job of this lol

business model building very quickly when you build a product you might want it to be perfect and you might get in your own way perfecting it where you could get 6 moths of feedback from customers instead and responding to that insight 

overenginering the solution had gotten them in trouble get the insights, put a version out letting the customer tell you what they are using it and what they are willing to pay for

when they started one kin is when he decided he was leaving wallstreet and didn't leave till4 yers later
