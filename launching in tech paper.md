built a team based on values not friendships
couldn't take off the friend hat and see them as ceo\

they had a team in the ukraine and they had to separate
everything is personal as a founder its hard to make decisions and they can be painful but everything is personal

russia controlled the ukraine media russia had assured ukraine 

going beyond your skillset
strengths and value got them to the right team
networking and partners

taking of the founder hat to be ceo
hyper deliberte and hyper prescriptive 
how we progress toward that 100 day vision this is the type of person i need to become to deliver on this vision

at the earlier stages you are both founder and ceo
theres a point where you transition to fully ceo and it can be hard to make that transition

thinking several steps ahead
identifying where the gaps are and digging in and being willing to fill it

dev shop is a development shop its way alot of people get tech support 
it is outsourcing for technical talent and you can outsource any part of it but esp early on they may have something in house but the bulk 

outsourcing in the beginning and then you have the resources to bring everything in house local talent

what is there business
