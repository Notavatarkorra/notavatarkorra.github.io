## 📍 **Steps to Become a Licensed Compounding Pharmacy**

### ✅ 1. **Decide Your Type of Compounding**

|Type|What It Involves|
|---|---|
|**Non-Sterile Compounding (USP <795>)**|Capsules, creams, sublinguals, lozenges, etc. (e.g., hormone pills)|
|**Sterile Compounding (USP <797>)**|IVs, injectables (not necessary for your focus)|
|**Hazardous Drug Compounding (USP <800>)**|Handling hormones or chemo agents — likely applies to you|

Start with **non-sterile + USP <800>** compliance if you're working with hormones.
