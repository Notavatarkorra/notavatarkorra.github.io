**Subject: Committee Reappointment Progress Report – June 2025**

The annual reappointment process for the hospital’s standing committees is progressing on schedule. We have taken key steps to ensure the timely reorganization of all medical staff committees and expect to complete the process by mid-July, pending final confirmations.

### Status Summary

A total of ten committees are being staffed this year. The Chief of Staff has personally contacted all selected committee chairs by phone, and follow-up thank-you emails have been sent to each on the Chief’s behalf. Emails have also been sent to physicians not being reappointed to notify them of the change.
