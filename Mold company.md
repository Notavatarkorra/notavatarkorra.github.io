lean Business Model Canvas ‚Äì Mold Risk Protection & Prevention**

---

#### üß© **Problem & Solution**

**Problem:**  
Mold in homes is one of the most common and expensive health hazards. However, most home insurance policies do **not cover mold damage** unless it's caused by a listed peril (like a natural disaster). Additionally, homeowners often **miss early signs** due to lack of regular maintenance, leading to long-term damage and health risks.

**Solution:**

- **Solution A**: A **mold-specific supplemental insurance** policy that covers mold remediation regardless of cause ‚Äî leaks, humidity, condensation, or HVAC failure.
    
- **Solution B**: A **preventative maintenance company** that performs regular mold-risk inspections and fixes common triggers like water leaks, poor ventilation, and plumbing issues.
