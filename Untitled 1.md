## IS1800 Programming Concepts Quiz
The questions 21,20,18,14 are all missing parts of the question (the line of code used to determine the answer)

Can you please remediate this please?

I also wanted to ask if you would be willing to reset assignments
"[Word Module 1 SAM End of Module Project 2](https://umsystem.instructure.com/courses/316068/assignments/3057473)"
"[Word Module 3 SAM End of Module Project 2](https://umsystem.instructure.com/courses/316068/assignments/3057481)" i submitted these early on accident when i didn't know how the system worked for submissions and i was just clicking on things, and was hoping for another chance at these.

Also i know the excel assignments and the file path assignment are all 0s i'm working on submitting these late slowly but surely!

Thank you!
