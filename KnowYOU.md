## ADHD Medications During Pregnancy

- Reassuring data from Denmark suggests **prenatal exposure to medications like methylphenidate** does **not significantly raise** risk for ADHD or other developmental disorders [nyulangone.org+3womensmentalhealth.org](https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/infants-exposed-to-adhd-medications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
### 🧪 1. Estrogen Fluctuations & ADHD Symptoms (NIH Pilot Study)

- A small pilot study (n=33 naturally cycling women) tracked **within-person declines in estrogen**, finding that dips—particularly around menstruation—were linked to worsened inattention and executive function issues [healthline.com+6reporter.nih.gov+6sciencedirect.com+6](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10476401?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- These results align with observational data indicating that ADHD symptoms can increase in low-estrogen phases of the cycle .
    

This work suggests estrogen levels modulate cognitive control in females with ADHD.

### ✅ Core Hormone Panel

|Hormone|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|**Estradiol (E2)**|Main form of estrogen; low levels can cause cognitive and mood symptoms|
|**Progesterone**|Should be in balance with estrogen; helps with calm, focus, and sleep|
|**Testosterone (free + total)**|Low levels = fatigue, low libido, brain fog|
|**DHEA-S**|Supports adrenal function and hormone precursors|
|**LH & FSH**|Help determine if your ovaries are functioning normally|
|**Cortisol (AM)**|High or low = stress dysregulation, fatigue, anxiety|
|**TSH, Free T3, Free T4, and reverse T3**|Rule out thyroid dysfunction (often missed)|
