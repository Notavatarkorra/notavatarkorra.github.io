Progestin is a synthetic version of the hormone pregesterone

## ADHD Medications During Pregnancy

- Reassuring data from Denmark suggests **prenatal exposure to medications like methylphenidate** does **not significantly raise** risk for ADHD or other developmental disorders [nyulangone.org+3womensmentalhealth.org](https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/infants-exposed-to-adhd-medications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
### üß™ 1. Estrogen Fluctuations & ADHD Symptoms (NIH Pilot Study)

- A small pilot study (n=33 naturally cycling women) tracked **within-person declines in estrogen**, finding that dips‚Äîparticularly around menstruation‚Äîwere linked to worsened inattention and executive function issues [healthline.com+6reporter.nih.gov+6sciencedirect.com+6](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10476401?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- These results align with observational data indicating that ADHD symptoms can increase in low-estrogen phases of the cycle .
    

This work suggests estrogen levels modulate cognitive control in females with ADHD.

### ‚úÖ Core Hormone Panel

|Hormone|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|**Estradiol (E2)**|Main form of estrogen; low levels can cause cognitive and mood symptoms|
|**Progesterone**|Should be in balance with estrogen; helps with calm, focus, and sleep|
|**Testosterone (free + total)**|Low levels = fatigue, low libido, brain fog|
|**DHEA-S**|Supports adrenal function and hormone precursors|
|**LH & FSH**|Help determine if your ovaries are functioning normally|
|**Cortisol (AM)**|High or low = stress dysregulation, fatigue, anxiety|
|**TSH, Free T3, Free T4, and reverse T3**|Rule out thyroid dysfunction (often missed)|

## üß† Step 2: What Kind of Doctor to Look For

### ‚úÖ Option A: **Functional or Integrative MD/DO**

- These providers look beyond "normal" lab ranges and treat based on **optimal function** and symptoms
    
- Often offer **bioidentical hormone therapy**, nutritional support, and root-cause analysis
    
- Search terms:
    
    - ‚ÄúFunctional medicine doctor near me‚Äù
        
    - ‚ÄúIntegrative hormone specialist [your city]‚Äù
        
    - ‚ÄúADHD and hormone imbalance doctor‚Äù
        
    - Or use: IFM.org Practitioner Finder (Institute for Functional Medicine)
        

### ‚úÖ Option B: **Naturopathic Doctor (ND)**

- Trained in hormone testing and often more comfortable with **cycle-based treatment plans**
    
- Good at working with lifestyle + natural supports (adaptogens, herbs, bioidentical hormones)
    

### ‚úÖ Option C: **Gynecologist or Endocrinologist**

- More conservative. May run labs but **only treat if you‚Äôre out of clinical range**
    
- Often prescribe birth control rather than treat low estrogen directly
    

> üî• Best strategy: **Start with a functional or integrative provider** who understands hormone-brain links. They‚Äôre more likely to validate your symptoms and take early estrogen changes seriously.

## üìû Step 3: What to Say When You Book

When calling or booking online, you can say:

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm experiencing cycle-related cognitive and mood symptoms like brain fog, focus issues, fatigue, and emotional swings. I‚Äôm interested in hormone testing ‚Äî including estradiol, progesterone, and thyroid ‚Äî to investigate possible imbalances.‚Äù

Or if ADHD is part of your concern:

> ‚ÄúI have ADHD and notice my symptoms shift during my cycle. I want to explore whether estrogen and progesterone levels are affecting that and get functional testing and guidance.‚Äù

## üß© Bonus: If You Can‚Äôt Access a Specialist Right Away

- Use services like **ZRT Labs** or **DUTCH test** (both allow at-home hormone testing; some require provider sign-off)
