Culture when i first got here: 
Staff: CJ - Alex, Martin, Stanley, Scott, Kylan, Korra

We weren't allowed to participate in events cause we had to stay back, or one person had to, or we took shifts. Had to focus on providing support during events so didn't mingle much.

We weren't even that busy. 

People around me talked so highly about the development and moving where you wanted to go, and how the opportunity was endless, and we train and promote from within.

Well i saw that happen with Chris and martin and stanley and Scott

But after that we had Heather, Vivian, Me Alex, Kylan, Mark B.

Mark, alex, and kylan all left because they were not seeing training or growth opportunities.
We also got really really bu
They watched as other teams brought on contractors to train and get hired instead.
