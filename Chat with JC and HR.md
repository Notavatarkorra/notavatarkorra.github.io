Culture when i first got here: 
Staff: CJ - Alex, Martin, Stanley, Scott, Kylan, Korra

We weren't allowed to participate in events cause we had to stay back, or one person had to, or we took shifts. Had to focus on providing support during events so didn't mingle much.

We weren't even that busy. 

People around me talked so highly about the development and moving where you wanted to go, and how the opportunity was endless, and we train and promote from within.

Well i saw that happen with Chris and martin and stanley and Scott

But after that we had Heather, Vivian, Me Alex, Kylan, Mark B.
We started getting really really busy summer of 24. 
We didn't have the bandwidth to do extra training or learn new things with other teams because they just kept dumping busywork on us like forescout
August we started getting flooded with calls and tickets.
We also realized we weren't tracking our data correctly this year, we weren't capturing the actual number of calls. Callbacks weren't even being counted.

So we were presenting data that's not been accurate for the last year or two and trying to improve our data. Our data was showing we were doing even less work than what we were doing. But we were getting really overloaded.

I got put on what was considered close to a performance plan because i didn't appear to my peers like i was growing and developing. 
me and CJ spent zero time on development though. 
I was also given it late

so, we were being given almost no opportunities for growth and development, we should have the time to sit down with other teams and take a look at the things they do and learn what they do. That was what they told us part of the great part about being on helpdesk was here. Yet we saw none of it and then we got too busy to even do any of it.

So now we are too busy for opportunities to learn new things or train with other teams, and too busy to work on our own development on our own. 

Joe literally said, in our meeting last week, development just has to be on hold right now. Which (is that not what CJ got let go for?)

 I asked for an ETA on when we are going to have some answers about when this struggle buss time is going to end or get better, or have some hope that there will be change.

A year now of being too busy and too overloaded and too stressed constantly with no hope for change or when it will get better. I wanted to start looking at VDC and their intro program, and that's been on hold for almost a year now because we are so busy.

So because we were so busy, our team had like 0 time for training and development opportunities. 

Mark, alex, and kylan all left because they were not seeing training or growth opportunities or potential for advancement.
