Culture when i first got here: 
Staff: CJ - Alex, Martin, Stanley, Scott, Kylan, Korra

We weren't allowed to participate in events cause we had to stay back, or one person had to, or we took shifts. Had to focus on providing support during events so didn't mingle much.

We weren't even that busy. 

People around me talked so highly about the development and moving where you wanted to go, and how the opportunity was endless, and we train and promote from within.

Well i saw that happen with Chris and martin and stanley and Scott

But after that we had Heather, Vivian, Me Alex, Kylan, Mark B.
We started getting really really busy summer of 24. 
We didn't have the bandwidth to do extra training or learn new things with other teams because they just kept dumping busywork on us like forescout. Or more than half the people that receive a new pc, they don't work off the bat and can't get in.

August we started getting flooded with calls and tickets.
We also realized we weren't tracking our data correctly this year, we weren't capturing the actual number of calls. Callbacks weren't even being counted.

So we were presenting data that's not been accurate for the last year or two and trying to improve our data. Our data was showing we were doing even less work than what we were doing. But we were getting really overloaded.

I got put on what was considered close to a performance plan because i didn't appear to my peers like i was growing and developing. 
me and CJ spent zero time on development though. 
I was also given it late

so, we were being given almost no opportunities for growth and development, we should have the time to sit down with other teams and take a look at the things they do and learn what they do. That was what they told us part of the great part about being on helpdesk was here. Yet we saw none of it and then we got too busy to even do any of it.

So now we are too busy for opportunities to learn new things or train with other teams, and too busy to work on our own development on our own. 

Joe literally said, in our meeting last week, development just has to be on hold right now. Which (is that not what CJ got let go for?)

 I asked for an ETA on when we are going to have some answers about when this struggle buss time is going to end or get better, or have some hope that there will be change.

A year now of being too busy and too overloaded and too stressed constantly with no hope for change or when it will get better. I wanted to start looking at VDC and their intro program, and that's been on hold for almost a year now because we are so busy.

So because we were so busy, our team had like 0 time for training and development opportunities. 

Mark, alex, and kylan all left because they were not seeing training or growth opportunities or potential for advancement. 
They just saw our team getting overloaded, fixing problems that other teams caused by other teams' carelessness, or poor process management.
And they saw other teams taking on contractors to train and then hire. This spot or oppertunity was previously where helpdesk would come in.

So now that helpdesk has no time, and other teams are just bringing on contractors, this limits the growth and development of HD, and crushes hopes of promotion.

Ontop of all that, they will not give us more people to soften the load and reduce stress. They did promote heather to team lead thankfully and that did help some, she did start to try and work on development with us before it got too busy.

We have been at 40+ tickets since january. 
CJ and heather were taking and working tickets we were do underwater
Our call volume was also insane, seeing numbers like 50/60 calls regularly.

call volume has gone down some but we still have crazy days like that. 

I think the reason CJ didn't work on development with us because his plate was just too full all the time and Joe did little mentoring and guiding and just kept him so busy. He seemed stressed all the time. He would ask joe for help, joe wouldn't give it to him then get mad at his performance and say why didn't you ask for help.

So moving Heather up helped this, but besides that change, theres been no addition of help. No extra people, and we are just constantly underwater, we barely have time to breath, our day is full to the brim, its causing the quality of work to go down, and our mental health has not been good.

Its also caused alot of tension with other teams, because we ask for help, or we escalate something because we miss something, or because we just don't have time and they get onto us hard about it, and we are like just begging for patience and understanding and they are just always like
oh we will make a guru so can take this on int he future, or like you missed this and we are like yes we know can you please just help us out we are dying and they  have this attitude like we are just dogs or something or trying to push work to them when we are just cleaning up their messes and taking on their busywork

the dynamic does not feel good or healthy and hasn't for a while.
Joe keeps saying well if the numbers show we need it then we can doit, but its like, the numbers aren't accurate, we are telling you what we need, we weren't meeting our metrics for a long time because it was so hard

and so CJ is pushing for change, and for help for us, and then he gets fired. That does not look good when they only one fighting for you gets fired.

Joe doesn't really seem to care that we are drowning and stressed. We don't feel like other teams care or notice either because they of their aversion to doing us ANY favors or ANY work that sounds like something we are capable of.

Its really not good. And people are afraid to make a fuss about it because they keep us too busy to complain, and now we are scared of getting fired. We need more people we can't continue working like this. We will continue to have turnover if so. 

So i get this improvement plan that i'm working on, i barely have time to work on it because i have no time

i'm told i need to work on my development, but i'm also being told that my development needs to be on hold for a year, but they need to see improvement, WHILE its crazy? It feels so so awful. 

And last year, during the holiday season we were short staffed and it was crazy, i worked so hard to keep  up with everything, it felt like we were being suffocated, and then to not get my bonus after going through that, felt SO bad. After i felt like i worked so hard to keep us afloat.

and i'm being told that my peers on the service delivery team don't think i'm developing enough or at the right pace, and like i don't even see or interact with these people, and they don't have evidence its just their opnion. So i'm being reviewed by people that don't even work with me, and critqued for not developing enough, when they aren't really allowing us to even do that.
