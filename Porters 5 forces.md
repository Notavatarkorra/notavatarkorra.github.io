**When launching a new business, you must also consider the competing forces of your buyers, suppliers, substitutes, new entrants and existing rivals.**

**

Watch the Porter’s 5 Forces Explained video and think through all  5 Forces for your business. Brainstorm 2-3 ways you can proactively solve for each force. Post must include all 5 forces:

·   Threat of new entrants

·    Threat of substitutes

·    Bargaining power of buyers

·    Bargaining power of suppliers

·    Rivalry among existing    

competitors

To successfully enter this market we have developed the following  
strategies (Porter’s 5 Forces strategies)  
1. Competitive Rivalry (Existing Competitors)  
Differentiate through personalized, biology-based care  
Most ADHD solutions focus on stimulants and generalized protocols.  
KnowYOU offers something new: hormone-informed treatment,  
tailored to women — a niche that’s currently underserved. This creates  
early differentiation and brand distinction.

1. Threat of New Entrants  
**Your goal:**  

Build **barriers to entry** by developing proprietary systems, securing partnerships, and meeting complex regulations.

Build regulatory and clinical partnerships early to create barriers to  
entry  
 Partner with them to use their licenses, infrastructure, or know-how to ensure compliance.
#### . **Legal or Compliance Consultants**
- These aren't formal partners like labs or pharmacies, but working with a **regulatory consultant**, FDA expert, or healthcare attorney ensures you're building a business that won't get shut down.
- 
- #### **Telehealth Providers (Licensed Physicians & Platforms)**- 
- 
- #### **503A Compounding Pharmacies**
**Why it's regulatory:** These pharmacies follow FDA and state board rules to compound personalized medications.

#### **CLIA-Certified Labs**
**Why it's regulatory:** CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) certification is federally required to run diagnostic lab tests in the U.S.
    
- **My partnership:** I send the at-home test kits to a CLIA-certified lab to stay compliant with testing regulations.
    
- **My partnership:** By sourcing custom hormone treatments from them, you avoid violating pharmacy compounding laws.
-
why this is necessary: Prescribing medication across state lines or diagnosing patients requires valid medical licenses and HIPAA-compliant platforms.

By securing partnerships with 503A pharmacies, licensed telehealth  
providers, and CLIA-certified labs — and pursuing HIPAA-compliant  
infrastructure — KnowYou makes it harder for copycat brands to enter  
without similar groundwork.  

How to afford to doit:
### **1. Use Pay-Per-Use or Revenue-Sharing Models**

- **no prepay or buy in bulk.** Instead, structure partnerships where I only pay when i make a sale.
    
- **Example:** Lab charges $90/test > I charge $200/test > $110 gross margin per kit.
    
- **Compounding pharmacy:** Only fills prescriptions as needed, means no inventory overhead.



2. Threat of Substitutes  
Position KnowYOU as the root-cause alternative to stimulants  
Instead of being “just another ADHD treatment,” KnowYOU positions  
itself as a deeper solution — one that addresses hormonal imbalances  
rather than just masking symptoms. So instead of trying to compete in the same category as stimulants, I'm trying to redefine it and create a new category, one that only i will occupy going in. This will also make it hard to substitute for my company because it will be seen as different, rather than interchangeable 

substitute products satisfy the same needs but if i create a different need, i can redefine ADHD care and say  something like "This is not just treating ADHD; we're decoding the biological rhythm behind it. This is hormone-integrated cognitive functioning care.”


2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers  
Diversify partnerships with labs, pharmacies, and telehealth  
providers

To reduce dependency on any single supplier, KnowYOU can onboard  
multiple lab and pharmacy partners and use a modular telehealth  
system. This keeps pricing and fulfillment power in balance.  
5. Bargaining Power of Buyers (Customers)  
Create a sticky customer experience through subscription and  
community  
By offering bundled services (test kits + consults + treatment), loyalty  
rewards, and an education-focused brand, KnowYou keeps users  
engaged and educated about their body. When people feel understood  
and supported, they’re less likely to leave for generic alternatives.
