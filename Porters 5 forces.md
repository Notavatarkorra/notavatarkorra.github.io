**When launching a new business, you must also consider the competing forces of your buyers, suppliers, substitutes, new entrants and existing rivals.**

**

Watch the Porter’s 5 Forces Explained video and think through all  5 Forces for your business. Brainstorm 2-3 ways you can proactively solve for each force. Post must include all 5 forces:

·   Threat of new entrants

·    Threat of substitutes

·    Bargaining power of buyers

·    Bargaining power of suppliers

·    Rivalry among existing    

competitors

To successfully enter this market we have developed the following  
strategies (Porter’s 5 Forces strategies)  
1. Competitive Rivalry (Existing Competitors)  
Differentiate through personalized, biology-based care  
Most ADHD solutions focus on stimulants and generalized protocols.  
KnowYou offers something new: hormone-informed treatment,  
tailored to women — a niche that’s currently underserved. This creates  
early differentiation and brand distinction.

1. Threat of New Entrants  
Build regulatory and clinical partnerships early to create barriers to  
entry  
By securing partnerships with 503A pharmacies, licensed telehealth  
providers, and CLIA-certified labs — and pursuing HIPAA-compliant  
infrastructure — KnowYou makes it harder for copycat brands to enter  
without similar groundwork.  



2. Threat of Substitutes  
Position KnowYou as the root-cause alternative to stimulants  
Instead of being “just another ADHD treatment,” KnowYou positions  
itself as a deeper solution — one that addresses hormonal imbalances  
rather than just masking symptoms. Framing this as a category shift  
reduces substitution risk.

2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers  
Diversify partnerships with labs, pharmacies, and telehealth  
providers

To reduce dependency on any single supplier, KnowYou can onboard  
multiple lab and pharmacy partners and use a modular telehealth  
system. This keeps pricing and fulfillment power in balance.  
5. Bargaining Power of Buyers (Customers)  
Create a sticky customer experience through subscription and  
community  
By offering bundled services (test kits + consults + treatment), loyalty  
rewards, and an education-focused brand, KnowYou keeps users  
engaged and educated about their body. When people feel understood  
and supported, they’re less likely to leave for generic alternatives.
