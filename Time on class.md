With all due respect, 10 hours is physically impossible.
According to my math there are 12 exams and trainings. I grouped the first windows exams and trainings into just one hour because those are shorter and those assignments were shorter so i'm counting those assignments and trainings as just two hours all together because getting started and navigating the course is new and tricky. SO 1 Hours for the windows assignments and 1 hour listening to the sylabus and navigating the course

After that there are 12 exams and trainings. The trainings take a MIMIMUM of an hour because theres about 60 questions. Generously thats 30 seconds for her to explain it and 30 seconds for you to doit. They honestly take more like 1 hour and 30 minutes if you account for making mistakes and redoing some, or repeating what she said. 

The exams are the same so already the exams and trainings take 12 hours.
Each assignment takes about 20 minutes. Really they take about 30 minutes if you are checking your graded work and resubmitting for points 
so generously we can say 25 min per assignment. 

12 assignments 
capstone assignments take longer so we will say 30 minutes for those. 
25x 12 is 300 
Thats 5.5 hours

So already at the MINIMUM this is 17.5 hours that you cannot refute. 

Unless someone already knows what they are doing completely and is speeding through it all or somehow moding the assignments and cheating

So it takes a minimum of 17.5 hours thats also if you are ONLY spending a miniute per question on the exams and trainings, thats not including the half hour it takes to repeat things, make mistakes, try again, actually work through the trainings, not to mention trouble focusing or normal human learning, so for someone like me who is learning all of this for the first time and not whizzing through it, its taking me the extra half hour on every training and exam and more like 30 minutes per assignment because i'm reading and trying intake and google how to do something if i don't remember it or its not clear. so add on 5 minutes to every assignment and 30 onto the trainings and exams and you are at
