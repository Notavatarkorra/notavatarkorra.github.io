With all due respect, 10 hours is physically impossible.
According to my math there are 12 exams and trainings. I grouped the first windows exams and trainings into just one hour because those are shorter and those assignments were shorter so i'm counting those assignments and trainings as just two hours all together because getting started and navigating the course is new and tricky. SO 1 Hours for the windows assignments and 1 hour listening to the sylabus and navigating the course

After that there are 12 exams and trainings. The trainings take a MIMIMUM of an hour because theres about 60 questions. Generously thats 30 seconds for her to explain it and 30 seconds for you to doit. They honestly take more like 1 hour and 30 minutes if you account for making mistakes and redoing some, or repeating what she said. 

The exams are the same so already the exams and trainings take 12 hours.
Each assignment takes about 20 minutes. Really they take about 30 minutes if you are checking your graded work and resubmitting for points 
so generously we can say 25 min per assignment.
