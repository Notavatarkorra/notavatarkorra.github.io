With all due respect, your answer of 10 hours is physically impossible.
According to my math there are 12 exams and trainings. I grouped the first windows exams and trainings into just one hour because those are shorter and those assignments were shorter so I'm counting those assignments and trainings as just two hours all together because getting started and navigating the course is new and tricky. SO 1 Hours for the windows assignments and exams and 1 hour listening to the syllabus and navigating the course. 

After that there are 12 exams and trainings. The trainings take a MIMIMUM of an hour because there's about 55-66 questions. GENEROUSLY that's 30 seconds for her to explain it and 30 seconds for you to doit. They honestly take more like 1 hour and 30 minutes if you account for the fact that that's an extra minimum of 6 minutes per exam that's 66 minutes, making mistakes and redoing ones you messed up, or repeating what she said. 

The exams are the same so already the exams and trainings take 12 hours.
Each assignment can take about 20 minutes. Really they take about 30 minutes if you are checking your graded work and resubmitting for points 
so generously we can say 25 min per assignment. 

12 assignments 
25 minutes per 12 assignments is 300 
That's 5.5 hours

So already at the MINIMUM this is 17.5 hours that you cannot refute. 

So regrouping so we are on track first we have the:
-Minimum 12 hours for exams and trainings
-add on all the assignments due, we are at the new minimum of 17.5

NOW for the  REALISTIC hours.

So it takes a minimum of 17.5 hours that's also only true if:
you are ONLY spending a minute per question on the exams and trainings, (hat's not including the half hour it takes to repeat questions, make mistakes, try again, actually work through the trainings like you are learning it for the first time. 

So realistically its taking about 1.5 hours

And that's not much longer. 90 Minutes divided by 66 questions is a minute and 30 seconds per question.

So the new realistic time: If you add 3 minutes onto the 12 exams/trainings you are at:
23.5 hours
Lets just round up the last half hour for grade checking, the extra 6 questions on the tests adding up to another 6 minutes per assignment, some are 55 so we are just grouping those generously here by rounding up to 24 hours.

24 HOURS not including any time for readings even.

Now to humanize the problem, and show you impossible 24 hours of homework for a class is.

I, also struggle with ADHD, its literally the bane of my existence, and makes me want to kill myself. 
So I struggle with ADHD and memory retention so its taking me longer than the average minimum time to read and comprehend all the instructions and assignments and taking time to redo them to get a better grade, or work through distractions. So i am already taking into account that i might be slower than the average person. Honestly, the exams and trainings personally take me closer to 2 hours sometimes because of this, and the assignments take me more like 30 minutes each. But i'm not going off that math because no body cares about disabilities, its all more unbelievable excuses. 

So we are going off a reasonable and normal estimate. I would love to know if you think 1 minutes and 30 seconds per training/exam question is unreasonable. My assumption is maybe you do since, you say only 10 hours. Also do you know how slowly that lecture in the training speaks? I found the speed up button a little late but even then, its:
30 seconds for her to explain, 30 seconds to perform, its not that much. 3- seconds to asses the problem, 30 seconds to perform, 30 seconds because you cant remember or have to redo. 1 minute 30 seconds. 24 hours. 

Unless someone already knows what they are doing completely and is speeding through it all or somehow modding the assignments and cheating, 10 hours is impossible. 

Please let me know if my math doesn't make sense. But your course, Its not even physically capable of being under 12 hours a week. Adding in the assignments its a minimum of 17.5 and if you consider the normal learning time it takes to read and comprehend and make mistakes and redo items, it REASONABLY takes at least 24.5 hours. 

How i'm at over 30 hours makes me think i'm still miscalculating things somewhere but i'm generously chalking the up to the fact i'm prolly slower than others and maybe its the adhd. I'm over 30 hours and still not even caught up though. And i am competent, maybe slow but I'm competent and work an office professional job in IT. So i'm not just an idiot, but i am learning a lot of this for the first time. (Which is how a course really should be, directed to people who don't already know the material)

So going off these calculations, id have to work on your homework for 5 hours straight 5 nights.

This isn't including any of the readings either. Or the file path assignment. 
Honestly i did 7. I stayed up all night one night and got 4 trainings and assignments done. Because for me i didn't find the speed up button for her voice until after, so they were taking me like 2 hours each.

But Professor. This means that if i come home from my 9-5, i'm spending 5 hours a night straight on your homework. 

I have one other accelerated class that actually does take 10 hours. 

So between two classes, that are not hard hard classes like calculous or something, i'm spending 34 hours on homework. That means between these two classes im doing homework 5 hours a day 7 days a week. That is insane, professor.  

5 hours of homework 7 days a week is so unrealistic. I work 40 hours a week at my job. God forbid i have sports, chores, exercise health or anything else i want to do, i physically cannot due to your class. 

My back and hands ache so much from this class, what if i had an injury or some kind of disease.

 My health should not be deteriorating over an information systems class. Maybe you think you are teaching a class to students who have literally nothing else to do over the summer, and that's great for them, but you are also teaching to realistic young professional adults with jobs, health needs, families etc. 

I hope you will do the math or do some timing  tests or SOMETHING to get some hard accurate data and times for this class and reconsider your course for someone that is new to the material and fits this demographic. Because i really don't understand how this can possibly be the expectation. So much for just living a normal healthy life with exercising cooking and chores, all that's going to have to be sacrificed in order to just do well in this class so my company pays for it because this course is thousands of dollars i can't pay back on my own. I really hope you can take what I'm saying seriously as a struggling concerned student and be more conscious and considerate with how you design your course. Because this infosys course of all courses is going to deteriorate me, my job, my partner, my home and my health.
