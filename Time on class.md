With all due respect, your answer of 10 hours is physically impossible.
According to my math there are 12 exams and trainings. I grouped the first windows exams and trainings into just one hour because those are shorter and those assignments were shorter so I'm counting those assignments and trainings as just two hours all together because getting started and navigating the course is new and tricky. SO 1 Hours for the windows assignments and exams and 1 hour listening to the syllabus and navigating the course. 

After that there are 12 exams and trainings. The trainings take a MIMIMUM of an hour because there's about 55-66 questions. GENEROUSLY that's 30 seconds for her to explain it and 30 seconds for you to doit. They honestly take more like 1 hour and 30 minutes if you account for the fact that that's an extra minimum of 6 minutes per exam that's 66 minutes, making mistakes and redoing ones you messed up, or repeating what she said. 

The exams are the same so already the exams and trainings take 12 hours.
Each assignment takes about 20 minutes. Really they take about 30 minutes if you are checking your graded work and resubmitting for points 
so generously we can say 25 min per assignment. 

12 assignments 
capstone assignments take longer so we will say 30 minutes for those. 
25x 12 is 300 
Thats 5.5 hours

So already at the MINIMUM this is 17.5 hours that you cannot refute. 

Unless someone already knows what they are doing completely and is speeding through it all or somehow moding the assignments and cheating

So it takes a minimum of 17.5 hours thats also if you are ONLY spending a miniute per question on the exams and trainings, thats not including the half hour it takes to repeat things, make mistakes, try again, actually work through the trainings, not to mention trouble focusing or normal human learning, so for someone like me who is learning all of this for the first time and not whizzing through it, its taking me the extra half hour on every training and exam and more like 30 minutes per assignment because i'm reading and trying intake and google how to do something if i don't remember it or its not clear. so add on 5 minutes to every assignment and 30 onto the trainings and exams and you are at another 7 hours. Thats 24.5 hours. Thats normal learning this for the first time human speed. 

I also struggle with ADHD and memory retention so its taking me longer than the average minimum time to read and comprehend all the instructions and assignments and taking time to redo them to get a better grade, or work through distractions. I personally am at over 30 hours because i take longer but i have just shown you that The amount of homework you have that you are stating is NOT 10 hours. Its not even physically capable of being under 12. Adding in the assignments its a minimum of 17.5 and if you consider the normal learning time it takes to read and comprehend and make mistakes and redo items, it REASONABLY takes at least 24.5 hours. 

How i'm at over 30 makes me think i'm still miscalculating things somewhere but i'm generously chalking the up to the fact i'm prolly slower than others and maybe its the adhd. 

So going off these calculations, id have to work on your homework for 5 hours straight 5 nights.

This isn't including any of the readings either. Or the file path assignment. 
Honestly i did 7. I stayed up all night one night and got 4 trainings and assignments done. Because for me i didn't find the speed up button for her voice until after, so they were taking me like 2 hours each.

But Professor. This means that if i come home from my 9-5, i'm spending 5 hours a night straight on your homework. 

I have one other accelerated class that actually does take 10 hours. 

So between two classes, that are not hard hard classes like calculous or something, i'm spending 34 hours on homework. That means between these two classes im doing homework 5 hours a day 7 days a week. That is insane, professor.  

5 hours of homework 7 days a week is so unrealistic. I work 40 hours a week at my job. God forbid i have sports, chores, exercise health or anything else i want to do, i physically cannot due to your class. 

My back and hands ache so much from this class, what if i had an injury or some kind of disease.

 My health should not be deteriorating over an information systems class. Maybe you think you are teaching a class to students who have literally nothing else to do over the summer, and that's great for them, but you are also teaching to realistic young professional adults with jobs, health needs, families etc. 

I hope you will do the math or do some timing  tests or SOMETHING to get some hard accurate data and times for this class and reconsider your course for someone that is new to the material and fits this demographic. Because i really don't understand how this can possibly be the expectation. So much for just living a normal healthy life with exercising cooking and chores, all that's going to have to be sacrificed in order to just do well in this class so my company pays for it because this course is thousands of dollars i can't pay back on my own. I really hope you can take what I'm saying seriously as a struggling concerned student and be more conscious and considerate with how you design your course. Because this infosys course of all courses is going to deteriorate me, my job, my partner, my home and my health.
